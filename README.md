📦 Repo: https://github.com/giannicottone/gianni-portfolio

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Project Status

This site is under active development. 
The current focus is on establishing a clean layout and maintainable structure before visual polish.

## Roadmap

This project is being built incrementally, with structure prioritized before polish.

### Phase One (Current)
- Finalize global layout and spacing
- Improve semantic HTML and accessibility
- Clean up unused components and styles

### Phase Two
- Flesh out portfolio content (projects, descriptions, links)
- Add dedicated project pages with technical context
- Refine navigation and page hierarchy

### Phase Three
- Visual polish and subtle UI enhancements
- Performance and SEO improvements
- Optional dynamic features as the site matures


## Branching & Workflow

Development follows an iterative, Agile-inspired workflow focused on small, incremental improvements.

- `main` is the only long-lived branch and always reflects a stable state
- Work is done on short-lived feature branches scoped to a single change or improvement
- Feature branches are rebased onto `main` to maintain a linear history
- Branches are deleted after merge to avoid stale context


This repository reflects an ongoing effort to balance clean structure, practical engineering decisions, and gradual refinement.
